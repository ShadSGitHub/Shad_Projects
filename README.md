## I'm seeking a job a software engineer and developer!

### :computer:  Programming

<!-- BASIC:START -->
- [Probablistic data Structure Skip-List ](https://github.com/ShadSGitHub/Shad_Projects/blob/main/SkipList-5%20(2).java)
    Skip List is a probabilistic data structure that stores and retrieves data in average runtime of O(Log n) based on probability.
 - [Trie Prediction](https://github.com/ShadSGitHub/Shad_Projects/blob/main/TriePrediction%20(4).c)
    Using a library of sentences, the algorithm would predict words to complete sentences using a Trie Tree data structure.
<!-- BASIC:END -->
### :robot: Machine learning
<!-- MACHINE LEARNING:START -->
- [LOCKHEED MARTIN SPONSOREDPROJECTEVERGLADES]
    University of central Florida Senior Design project sponsored by Lockheed Martin Corporation. The project entails the development of multiple reinforcement learning                algorithms. State of the art Algorithms Rainbow, Actor-Critic, and Proximal Policy Optimization where implemented to create an Artificial Intelligence agent to play Lockheed       Martinâ€™s game Ever Glades.
- [FASHION MNIST, SUPERVISED LEARING ARTIFICAL INTELLIGNCE]
    A machine deep learning agent to learning to classify different type of clothing by observing and learning from 60 thousand labeled images using Pytorch and Keras API
- [REGRESSION, LINEAR AND LOGISTIC REGRESSION]
    A machine learning project to estimate curves for data. Model is created for predicting linear and non-linear curves as well as with singular and multivariable models using        gradient and stochastic gradient decent.
- [LSTM AND RECURENT NN, TIME SERIES PREDICTION AND SENTIMENT ANALYSIS]
    Deep learning models using a simple Recurrent Neural Network to predict how many passengers to have given data of previous months. Sentiment Analysis model using LSTM or Long      Short Term Memory to predict positive or negative reviews from IMDB dataset all with Keras API.
- [IMAGE GENERATION, VARIATIONAL AUTOENCODERS](https://github.com/ShadSGitHub/Shad_Projects/tree/main/AutoEncoder)
    Deep learning model used to generate random images of a training data set. By training to produce images from a normal or Gaussian Distribution. 
- [IMAGE SEGMENTATION, IMAGE SEGMENTATION USING UNET ARTIFICAL INTELLIGNCE]
    A machine deep learning agent that learns to segment images of cells using UNET architecture, training through 670 images while using Dice Coefficient loss function.
