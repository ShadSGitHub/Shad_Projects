<!-- BASIC:START -->
- [Probablistic data Structure Skip-List ](https://github.com/ShadSGitHub/Shad_Projects/blob/main/SkipList-5%20(2).java)
    Skip List is a probabilistic data structure that stores and retrieves data in average runtime of O(Log n) based on probability.
 - [Trie Prediction](https://github.com/ShadSGitHub/Shad_Projects/blob/main/TriePrediction%20(4).c)
    Using a library of sentences, the algorithm would predict words to complete sentences using a Trie Tree data structure.
